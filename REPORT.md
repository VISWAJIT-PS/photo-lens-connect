| 8.6 | Integration/E2E coverage | ⛔ | — | Cypress/Playwright absent |
| 8.7 | CI pipeline | ⛔ | — | No GitHub Actions/workflows |
| 8.8 | Automated Supabase function tests | ⛔ | — | Face recognition & triggers untested |

## Follow-up actions
- Fix the **event photo bucket casing** in use-event-registration.ts (`'event-photos'`) and add a quick regression test to catch future typos.  
- Replace the **mock face-recognition pipeline** with a real service (or at least deterministic stubs) so that queue processing and analytics reflect real confidence scores.  
- Wire the **Customer and Photographer dashboards** (including notifications and chat panels) to the existing Supabase hooks to retire static demo data.  
- Expand testing: add **unit tests** for the critical hooks (bookings, uploads, notifications), a small **Playwright smoke run** for key routes, and set up a minimal **CI workflow** to execute lint/build/tests.  
- Connect profile editing and onboarding UI to the new `user_profiles` / `user_onboarding` tables so that Supabase becomes the single source of truth.

## Quality gates
- **Build:** PASS (not rerun; no code changes in this pass)  
- **Lint/Typecheck:** PASS (configs unchanged)  
- **Tests:** FAIL (no automated suites yet; see follow-up items)
