# Migration Fix Applied ✅

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Duplicate Migration Version `004`
The duplicate migration version `004` has been fixed. All migration files have been renumbered correctly.

### 2. Missing Tables in Migration 006
Fixed missing table definitions in `006_face_recognition_functions.sql`:
- Added `face_recognition_results` table
- Added `photo_matching_queue` table
- Commented out unimplemented `create_notification` function call

## Migration Order (Fixed)
```
001_create_photographers_table.sql
002_create_photo_lens_schema.sql
003_complete_photo_lens_schema.sql
004_enhanced_features_schema.sql
005_fix_photo_details_view.sql          (previously 004 - RENAMED)
006_face_recognition_functions.sql      (previously 005)
007_storage_security_policies.sql       (previously 006)
008_cart_and_booking_system.sql         (previously 007)
009_create_website_stats_table.sql      (previously 008 - NEW WEBSITE STATS)
```

## How to Apply the Website Stats Migration

### ✅ OPTION 1: Apply Only Website Stats (Recommended if migrations 001-008 are working)

1. Open your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/jmozptzjskyvzfghrtlw
2. Go to: **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the entire contents of: `scripts/setup-website-stats.sql`
4. Paste into the SQL Editor
5. Click "Run" or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter
6. You should see: "Success. No rows returned"

### ✅ OPTION 2: Apply All Pending Migrations at Once

If you're having issues with multiple migrations, use this comprehensive script:

1. Open your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/jmozptzjskyvzfghrtlw
2. Go to: **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the entire contents of: `scripts/apply-all-pending-migrations.sql`
4. Paste into the SQL Editor
5. Click "Run"
6. This will create:
   - `face_recognition_results` table
   - `photo_matching_queue` table
   - `website_stats` table
   - All required functions and policies

### ✅ OPTION 3: Using Supabase CLI

If you have Supabase CLI credentials configured:

```bash
cd /Users/farzanshibu/Programs/photo-lens-connect
supabase db push
```

**Note:** This will try to apply all pending migrations in order.

### ⚠️ OPTION 4: Apply Only New Migration (If 006 already exists)

If migrations 001-008 are already applied, you can manually run just migration 009:

```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, copy and run:
supabase/migrations/009_create_website_stats_table.sql
```

## Verification

After applying the migration, verify it worked:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT * FROM public.website_stats;
```

You should see one row with initial statistics.

## Test the Integration

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

2. Visit the homepage
3. You should see the statistics loading from Supabase

## Update Statistics

To refresh statistics based on real data:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT update_website_stats();
```

Then refresh your landing page to see updated values!

## Need Help?

- Check `WEBSITE_STATS_INTEGRATION.md` for detailed documentation
- Review `scripts/setup-website-stats.sql` for the SQL code
